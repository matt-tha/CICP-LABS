#### Conclusion

Here is where you can list any final thoughts and provide instructions for any necessary cleanup. 
Any changes to the VM system settings should be reset at the end of the lab to ensure future compatibility with other labs.

## Example

1. Maybe you told them to bring down network interface eth0 as part of the lab, make sure you tell them to bring it back up.

    ```
    sudo ifcofig eth0 up
    ```
    
It is NOT required to have them reset application settings because every lab should already include instructions to setup required settings.
